Cover letter paragraph 2: Highlight skills and qualifications
- Summarize 2-3 examples from your education, experience, and interests
- Show how your qualified for the job



================================================================================

Hello. In this video, we will talk about
ways to highlight your skills and qualifications in the cover letter. In paragraph two in the body of the cover
letter, you will summarize two or three examples from your education,
experience, and interests to show a future employer
how you are qualified for the job. The examples that you
choose will explain or support the information in your resume
not just repeat what's in your resume. This paragraph is your chance
to really stand out from all of the other applicants. Remember that employers are looking for people who can help their business or
organization be successful. Focus on how your skills and
qualifications will help them. When you are applying for
a specific position, it is a good idea to use the job
description or advertisement as a guide. The job description is
very useful because it has key words about the skills and
experience needed to do the job. Our applicant, Beth,
read a job description for an International Student Advisor,
with the keywords international students, two years of experience, and
excellent communication skills. Using the sample cover letters
from reading one, let's look and how Beth focused on her skills in
the second paragraph of her cover letter. In the beginning sentences, she writes about her current
job as a resident advisor. She gives very specific information
about the students she helps and the interpersonal and
the organizational skills she uses. In her first example, she explains
that she works with 40 students advises them and organizes programs. The last three sentences of these
paragraph, focus on her experience as a student when she assisted with
international student orientation and learned more about
international cultures and communications. Now, let's see how Tomical
show's her skills and qualifications in the cover letter. She begins with her administrative
skills and says that she has ten years of experience with Microsoft Office
as well as several web based programs. Her next example,
focuses on here language skills. She writes about her experience
studying in Spain and her volunteer experience with
people of diverse cultures. Tomical ends the paragraph well by connecting those skills
to a company's needs. The job posting says that they
need a administrative assistant with strong computer skills and
interpersonal skills. And Tomical does a good job of
explaining that she has those skills. As you can see, there are many ways for
job seekers to focus on their skills and qualifications in
paragraph two of the cover letter. Some choose to use two or
three examples from their education, work experience, or their interests. In their descriptions,
they are always trying to show future employers how they
are qualified for the job. Now, let's move on to a game, so you can practice matching the job
description with skills and examples.
