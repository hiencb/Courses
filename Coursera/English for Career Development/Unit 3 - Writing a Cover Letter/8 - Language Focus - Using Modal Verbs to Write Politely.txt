Hello, in this video we're going to talk
about using modal verbs to be more polite. When applying for a job in the United
States, it is important that job seekers are direct and honest,
but also respectful and polite. Modal verbs help the writer to
control the tone or feeling. This is how you will leave a positive
impression on your reader. We will begin with
the definition of modal verbs, the grammar structure and
the meaning or reasons why we use them. Then we will look at
example sentences with and without modal verbs to show how the same
message is given in different ways. Let's begin with a definition. Modal verbs are helping verbs such as can,
will, could, would, or might. These modal verbs show
a speaker's attitude or feeling that something is possible or
probable. Modal verbs are helping verbs
that are immediately followed by the simple form of a verb. Could and would are very common
modal verbs used in cover letters, emails and
conversations during the job search. When you use a modal verb in the sentence, it must be followed by another
verb in the simple form. Look at this example. I could assist the company by
working with international visitors. Now, let's talk about the meaning of can
and will, along with could and would. When a writer uses can or
will, it is very direct. Can means that the writer has
the ability to do something. And will shows that the writer is
making a future promise or prediction. Could or would show that something is
possible, probable, or very likely. These are more polite forms of can and
will. Let's look at some examples
from a cover letter. Number one, I can assist your
company in international markets. Number two, I could assist your
company in international markets. Number 1, just shows that
the person has the ability, but number 2 is more polite and shows the possibility of using
that ability to help the company. Here's another example with will and
would. Number 1, I will assist your
company in international markets. Number 2, I would assist your
company in international markets. It is rude for him to say I will assist
your company in international markets, because only the employer
gets to make that decision. If the applicant is too direct it changes
the tone or feeling of the message. Another meaning of the modal verb
would is a polite form of want. Want is often too direct and
can sometimes be rude. Would like is more indirect and polite. In a cover letter, applicants
want to have a job interview but need to politely say what they want. The way to do that is
by saying number one, I would like to discuss
the job in an interview. Or number two, I would like to learn
more about the company in an interview. It is very important that job seekers
communicate what they could do for a company and clearly say what they
want the company to do for them. Respectfully and politely. Let's review what we've
learned about modal verbs. Using modal verbs in writing and speaking is the best way to be direct,
but also polite. Job seekers can control their tone,
and leave a positive impression. We now know that modal verbs would and
could are used with other verbs to describe
things that are possible or likely. We can also use would like
to clearly show what we want in a polite and respectful way. Next go onto a game to practice using modal verbs in polite language.
