Hello, in this video we're going to talk
about the level of formality in your cover letter. We'll discuss why we need to think about
formality as we write it and look at some of the differences between formal and
informal tone or style in a cover letter. To begin, let's define what we
mean by level of formality. In English, as in many other languages,
we use different words and grammar forms depending on
the situation we're communicating in. So for example,
if I am speaking with my close friend, I would probably use more informal
language such as what's up Tony or how's it going,
you going to watch the game tonight? However, if I am speaking or writing to someone I don't know personally
and the context is more professional, then I should choose a more
formal style of language. Therefore expressions such as,
what's up Tony? How's it going?
Could be incorrect or rude in that situation. If the person who reads my cover letter
were to see such expressions they might be surprised, shocked or
even offended by my level of informality. With this in mind it is important
that you use formal words or phrases in your cover letter. Nowadays, many employers request
that you send your resume and cover letter by email rather
than by traditional mail. However, just because you are writing
your cover letter in an email, does not mean you should
write in an informal way, as if you are speaking with a friend,
or a family member. For example, how should you address
the person you are writing to? Should you say, Hi Mary, or Hi Mr. Smith, both of these greetings or
salutations are too informal. A more appropriate one is, Dear Mr.
Smith, if the person is a man, or Dear Ms. Smith,
if the person is a woman. If you don't know the sex of
the person you are addressing then, Dear Sir or Madam is a better choice. Likewise, in your closing it
would be interpreted as too informal if you were to write Bye or
Take care or Goodbye. A more formal alternative is Sincerely or Yours sincerely, and then you should
follow this with your full name. In the body of your cover letter or email
try to avoid using informal language. It's best not to use contractions
such as I'm, you're, it's etc. Use the longer forms,
I am, you are, it is. While these things might
seem small to you, they will contribute to the overall
professional tone of your writing. And help with creating
a good first impression. Finally, let's look at an example
of the opening of a cover letter. This one is written too informally. See what you think. Hi there, I saw your ad for
a receptionist in the paper and I'm really interested in the job. Clearly this is too informal. In the United States this
would not be acceptable and an employer who reads it might interpret
the writer as not being serious or professional enough for the job. So, the message is, always try and be professional in any
communication with an employer. Here's the sample rewritten,
so it's now more formal. Dear Ms. Smith, I was very interested
to read your advertisement for the position of receptionist in
the Seattle Herald dated May 6th 2011. I would like to be considered for
this job. In this video, we have looked at levels
of formality in a cover letter, and discussed the differences between
formal and informal styles. I hope you can see that using a more
formal style in your cover letter is what's expected from an employer. Next, we'll look at controlling tone with modal verbs.
