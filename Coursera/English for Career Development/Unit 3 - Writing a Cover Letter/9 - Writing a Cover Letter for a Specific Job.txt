Hello. In this the final video of Unit 3, we're going to talk about writing
your cover letter for a specific job. We will prepare for
the second assessment of this unit where you will first write your
own cover letter for a job. You will then read another
student's cover letter and fill out a checklist while reading
that person's cover letter. Typically, as we discussed in Unit 1,
in the United States, you will find job advertisements in newspapers,
job websites, or company websites. After finding a job you like and
are qualified for, you will apply for that position. To apply, the employer will usually ask
you to send a resume and a cover letter. After completing Unit 2,
you should already have a resume. Now after completing Unit 3, you should write a cover letter
to accompany you resume. To help you write this cover letter, we're going to ask you to
choose one of two options. Option one is to write a cover letter for
this job advertisement for a client services coordinator. It's the same one we saw in Unit 1. Option two is to find a job advertisement by yourself and
apply for that position remembering to
upload it along with your resume. This may be a great option for you if
you are currently applying to jobs and have found a posting that
you'd like to respond to. As you write your cover letter,
try and remember all the things we have discussed in this unit in relation
to writing a cover letter. Go back over the previous videos,
if that helps you, and look at the other sample cover letters used in this
unit as a guide when you write. Take you time doing this and
like when you wrote your resume in Unit 2, ask some one you trust
to read through it few times after you finish it to check it for
spelling, grammar and punctuation. Good luck with this. Next, in assessment two,
you will complete your own cover letter, upload it, and
then read someone else's cover letter. While you read through that person's cover
letter, you will complete a checklist. Thanks for watching, goodbye.
