================================================================================

Hello, in this video we will introduce
the parts of a professional letter and format of a letter or how it should look. In the United States, professional
writing follows a standard format or order and includes four parts. The first part is the heading which
includes the writer's address and contact information, the date and
the reader's name and address The second part is the salutation. The third part is
the three body paragraphs, opening paragraph, middle paragraph and
closing paragraph. And the fourth is the closing which
includes a complimentary close, a signature and a typed name. First the heading of a letter
begins with the writers address and additional contact information
such as e-mail address or phone number in the top left corner. Notice how this job seeker, Beth Bradley,
wrote her information here. The date follows the US format of month,
day and then year. Don't forget the comma
separates the two numbers. For example, Beth wrote this
letter on April 26th, 2016. The next part includes the full name and
address of the reader. In this example, Beth is sending the
letter to Jane Doe who is the Director of the Office of International Programs
at the University of Texas. In addition to the first and last name of
the reader, Beth also writes the title and the department as Jane Doe is
part of a large university. Since you may not know whether
the reader is a man or woman, it is acceptable to write the first and
last name only followed by the job title. Nowadays, many job applications
are completed online and job seekers may not know
who the reader will be. In this case, it is acceptable to leave
the name off of the readers address and simply put the department and
address of the organization. The second part of the letter
is the salutation, or official greeting, and
always begins with the word dear. Because this is a greeting,
it is better to have a person's name. Following the word dear, Beth uses
the persons full name and a colon. Beth knows the name of her reader, but if she didn't know she could
write Dear Hiring Manager. Generally, the salutation is better
if you have a person's name. But sometimes job advertisements do
not provide the name of the employer. Next, come the three body
paragraphs of the letter. This is where you introduce yourself. Explain your qualifications,
and ask for an interview. We will discuss each paragraph
in detail in later videos. The opening paragraph tells the reader
that you are applying for a specific job. We will talk about different ways
job seekers write this information In the next video. The middle paragraph is where job
seekers explain their skills and how they are qualified for
the specific job. We will look at examples and discuss how
to write this paragraph in a later video. The last paragraph is important because the closing should make
a positive impression of the candidate. We will talk about how to write
the closing paragraph in a later video. The end of the letter includes
a complimentary close, a signature and
the applicant's typed name. The complimentary close that is used most
often is sincerely followed by a comma. The signature is usually hand written by
the applicant followed by the typed name. As for the format, all parts of the letter should be
along the left side of the paper. The lines should be single-spaced, with
extra spaces between each of the parts. Writers should try to fit all
of the parts onto one page. Let's review the parts of
a professional letter. The heading includes
the writer's address and contact information, the date and
the readers name and address. The second part is the salutation. The third part includes
the body paragraphs. The closing part of the letter
includes a complimentary close. A signature and a typed name. Next, go on to a game to practice
matching the parts of the letter.
