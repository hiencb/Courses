Cover letter paragraph 3:
- Request to interview for the job
- Tell how they will follow up with the application
- Make a positive impression



================================================================================

Hello. In this video, we will talk about ways
to close or end the cover letter. In this paragraph, job seekers
make a request to interview for the job, tell how they will follow
up with the application and leave the reader with
a positive impression. These items can be written in any order. The goal of this paragraph is to
summarize your interest in the job, and show the employer that you are ready for
the next step, a job interview. Although job seekers do not make
the decision about the interview or schedule, they should plan to call or email the employer soon after
sending the application. This shows that the applicant
is serious about the job and may lead to an interview. Let's look at our example applicant
in the United States, Beth and see how she wrote the closing
paragraph of her cover letter. She begins this paragraph by
summarizing her experience and showing her interest at working
at the University of Texas. She then leaves a positive impression
by thanking the reader when she says thank you for
taking time to review my resume. She also tells the reader that she plans
to move to Austin at the end of May and that she will be available for
an interview at any time. This information is only necessary if you do not live in the same
location as the employer. You can see that that continues to making
her positive impression with phrases like would be delighted to meet with you and
I look forward to speaking with you soon. Because of her positive impression,
her summary of qualifications and interest, Beth's closing
paragraph is very effective. Let's look at another example
with Tomoko's closing paragraph. Tomoko begins the paragraph with a very
polite request for an interview by saying I would appreciate the opportunity to
discuss my qualifications in an interview. Her request is very indirect or polite but both applicants are clearly asking for
a chance to meet the employer in person. In the next sentence Tomoko says I will
contact your office your office next week. We don't know if this will be a phone
call or email but she can do one or both. Like Beth, she also specific
time by saying next week. Tomoko also leaves a positive
impression by thanking the reader and expressing her interest in meeting and
person when she says thank you for your consideration of my application and
I look forward to meeting with you. At the end of the cover letters, both job
applicants add a complimentary close, sincerely, followed by a comma,
their signature or handwritten name and
then their typed names. Your signature shows your personal style,
so be sure to write neatly and clearly so
that the reader can understand your name. To summarize, we've learned end
the cover letter with a closing paragraph that makes a request for
an interview, tells the reader how you plan to follow up and leaves
the reader with a positive impression. We also learned about the complimentary
close, signature and the typed name. Now let's move on to another video
which talks about present perfect and past tenses.
