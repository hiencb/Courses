Cover letter paragraph 1
- Statement of application
- Specific title of job opening
- Source of information



================================================================================

Hello, in this video we will talk about
ways to use your cover letter to introduce yourself to an employer. The first paragraph of
a cover letter must include a statement of application applying for
job, the specific title of the job opening,
and your source of information. This is the part of the letter
in which applicants show their interest in the position. Remember that the opening paragraph also
needs to get the employer's attention. Let's look at an example job seeker. Beth, who is applying for a position
as an International Student Advisor. In the opening paragraph
of her cover letter, Beth starts by explaining
that she read an article and the job advertisement in a newspaper,
the Austin Times. She puts this information
in the first sentence. After mentioning where she saw
the advertisement, her second sentence gives a clear statement of application
with the title of job opening. In the last sentence of this paragraph,
Beth highlights or focuses on her education and
area of specialization. This is a short paragraph but it tells an employer some
important information about her. She knows about the student population,
and her education makes her a good match for
the position. There are many ways to
write an opening paragraph. Each writer organizes and explains ideas
differently with their personal style. Let's look at another
example from reading one. Tomoko's cover letter. Like Beth, Tomoko begins with
the source of her information. She read about the job opening for an Administrative Assistant
in the Seattle Times. Tomoko chooses a more indirect approach. By saying that she read about a job
opening, and then gives the job title. The next sentence expresses her interest
in the position, because she shows that she understands the company's need
and that she is qualified to help them. In her last sentence, she chooses
to highlight her language skills, work experience and office skills. Again, this is a short paragraph, but it
tells the employer that the applicant know something about the company, and
that she has skills to help the company. Job postings are not only
found in newspapers nowadays. Sometimes job seekers
mention the source of information in the first sentence
of the opening paragraph. Especially if it is through
a personal reference. If the source of
information is a person or a website, the job applicant
might write something like this. One, at the XYZ regional conference,
your colleague, Jannie Qin, told me about the job
opening for an Executive Assistant. Two, I am applying for
the position of Administrative Assistant announced on the IronGate.com website. In summary, we've looked at the opening
paragraph or a cover letter. This paragraph serves as
the introduction to the applicant. And must include
a statement of application, the specific title of the job opening,
and the source of information. Some job seekers choose to briefly
write about their education, skills, or experience at the end as
a connection to the next paragraph. In the next video, we'll take a look
at cover letter paragraph two. Highlighting your skills
in the cover letter.
