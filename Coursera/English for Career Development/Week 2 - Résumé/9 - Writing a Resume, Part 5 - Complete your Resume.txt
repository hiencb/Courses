Hello. In this final video of Unit 2,
we'll talk about completing your resume. There are still some
things you will need to do to make your resume the best
resume you can write. One of these things has
to do with presentation. In other words, how your resume looks. Is it easy to read? Does it look good? Does it follow standard resume rules? The next thing we'll discuss is
proofreading and editing your resume. This means reading back over your
resume after you have written it and making sure it doesn't have any mistakes. Finally, we'll talk briefly
about the two most popular types of resumes,
functional and chronological. After this video,
we hope you will feel confident and ready to research and
write your own resume. The assessment that follows this
video will ask you to write your own resume, and
to read someone else's resume. To begin then, let's look at presentation. When an employer reads your resume, you want to be sure you make
a great first impression. You can achieve this not only by
having the skills, qualifications, and experience, but also making sure your
resume looks professionally written and is easy to read. As we've said before,
you don't want to give an employer an excuse to throw your
resume in the recycling can. After all, an employer will probably read many
other resumes before getting to yours. So if it doesn't follow what
we call standard formatting, it will not make a good first impression. Some examples of standard formatting
include using a standard font, for example, Times New Roman,
using bullet points, using lots of white space to
make the resume easier to read. Using bold text and indents to give
more importance to information and show relationships between information. If we look in this good example of
a resume, we can see each of these things. Beth Smith uses only two fonts,
Calibri and Ariel. Bullet points to summarize her skills and
work experience, lots of white space, and
she uses bold text and indents. The next thing you need to do after you
finish writing your resume is to read through it a few times, or get someone
else to read through it after you. You should read the resume looking for
mistakes in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. If you are unsure of the rules for each of
these things, ask someone who's an expert or read a reliable book or
website that explains the rules correctly. Make any necessary changes so
that your resume is free of any mistakes. Nowadays, most employers ask you
to send your resume by email or upload it to a job website. But if you're planning on sending
the resume through the mail, be sure that you use a good quality paper. In the United States,
you can buy cotton paper that is more expensive than regular printer paper,
but it makes all the difference. A better quality paper will make your
resume stand out from the crowd. Lastly, you should think about which
type of resume you should use. There are two common types of resume used
nowadays, functional and chronological. Chronological is the one
most commonly used. It lists your work experience and
qualifications in chronological order, starting with
the most recent first. It is the one most people
use when writing a resume. On the other hand,
a functional resume puts more emphasis on your abilities and
less on your work experience. If you have just graduated from
high school or college and don't have a lot of work experience,
you probably want to emphasize your education and qualifications,
and not your work experience. Or maybe you are just returning to
the workforce after being away for an extended period of time, for example,
because of illness or having a child. A functional resume may be
a better fit for you in this case. We will examine functional and
chronological resumes in more detail in the additional resources
at the end of the unit. For the moment, we hope you've learned
in this video the importance of good presentation, proof reading and
editing your finished resume and the basic differences between
functional and chronological resumes. It's now time you put the finishing
touches on your own resume. Be sure to carefully and thoroughly
research the job you're applying to and try to remember all the things
we discussed in this unit. Good luck. Next, in Assessment 2, we're going
to ask you to submit your resume and another student in this course
will read and review your work. Thanks for watching. Bye for now.
