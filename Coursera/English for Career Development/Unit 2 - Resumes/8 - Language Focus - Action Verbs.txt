Hi again, in this video we are going
to look at what we call action verbs. These are verbs that you should
use throughout your resume so you are a more attractive
candidate to an employer. We will look at some
examples of these verbs and see how we can use them in your resume. We use action verbs in our resumes
because they're more specific verbs. They tell the employer a lot
about what you do, or did, in your jobs than general verbs do. For example, if I said, worked at X
company, or did sales at Y company, that doesn't really tell
the employer very much. The verbs are too general, or unspecific. However, if I change worked to
developed a project at X company, where develop means to grow something. And I can change did to,
increased sales at Y company, where increase means to maker bigger. Now it sounds much better,
I have a more active role rather than a passive one,
I am more in control. Action verbs are usually grouped
together by job or skill type. Since many jobs require you
to have multiple skills, you will probably be choosing action
verbs from different skill types. There are lots of action
verbs to choose from, but for our purposes today,
we are going to look at a shorter list. As I mentioned earlier, if we choose
the verb do or make, it is too general, but we could use a more specific
verb like developed or increased. Likewise, I could say in my resume, I wrote a proposal,
where proposal means a plan. However, what if I use a more
specific verb, such as, drafted, which means to prepare
an early version of a text. So now I write, I drafted a proposal, or I could say I edited a report,
where the verb edit means to correct or
change a written document. I could also use a general verb like talk,
as in, I talked with the customer. Or I could use a more specific verb like,
I negotiated with the customer, where negotiate means to
try to reach an agreement. Or I corresponded with a new customer, where the verb correspond means to
write and respond to communication. I hope you can see how, not only are my
choice of verbs more specific, but they, more importantly, make my role
in this job sound more active. In this video,
we looked at action verbs and highlighted their importance
when writing your resume. We talked about how using action verbs
is much better than general verbs, as they make you sound a more skilled and
accomplished worker. Next, we'll play a game to
practice using action verbs.
