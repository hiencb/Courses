Hello, in this video, we'll be talking about the forth
part of a resume, education. This part of the resume is very
important for current students, recent university graduates, or
people with little work experience. For people with a lot of work experience, the education section shows that they
meet the required education level. Job advertisement usually
have a required degree as part of the qualifications for the job. Job seekers list each educational
experience they have had and include the name of the school,
the location. The degree received major or subject of
specialty, and the year of graduation. Those who received high grades or
special honors during their education sometimes include
those awards in this section. The development of the education
part of the resume often shows future employers your academic
performance, management and technical abilities and
general areas of interest. There are many kinds of degrees that
are included in the education section. The most common types of degrees
in the United States are one, AA or AAS, which is associate of arts or
associates of applied science. These are two year degrees from community
colleges and technical schools. Two is B.A. or B.S., Bachelor of Arts or
Bachelor of Science. These are typically four year degrees
from a college or a university. Three, M.A. or M.S.,
Master of Arts or Master of Science. These are graduate level
degrees from a university. Number four is M.B.A.,
Master of Business Administration. This is a graduate degree in
business from a university. And five is PhD. A doctorate degree is the highest
level degree from a university. Like the work experience
section of a resume. Job seekers list there educational
history in reverse chronological order. Beginning with the most resent or
current degree program. Here is an example job seeker. Michael Johnson, who attended one
university and earned two degrees. Notice how he begins with
the name of the school and the location, that's city and state. In this example, he attended
Cornell University in the city of Ithaca, in the state of New York. On the next line,
he lists his most recent degree, an M.B.A. in General Management,
which he completed in 2015. This is a graduate level Master's Degree
in Business Administration with a special focus or
major in general management. Next, he lists his B.A.
in sociology which he completed in 2009. His Bachelor of Arts degree
is a four year degree and sociology is the subject
area that he studied most. After listing the degrees,
Michael includes an award that he earned in 2008 and 2009. In United States Universities,
Dean's List awards go to students who received very high grades
at the end of the academic year. Many people put this information
in their resume to show that they were very successful in their courses. Let's review part four of the resume,
education. In this section, job seekers show each educational experience separately
in reverse chronological order. Each entry must include the name
of the school, the location, the degree received, major or
subject area, and the year of graduation. The addition of awards or
honors is not required. But does provide good information
about a future employee. Job seekers include all of their education to show that they meet the required
education level for the position. Being very successful in one's education often means that a job seeker
is serious and a hard worker. Now, we will move on to the next video,
which will help you to learn how to use action verbs to describe
your experience very clearly.
