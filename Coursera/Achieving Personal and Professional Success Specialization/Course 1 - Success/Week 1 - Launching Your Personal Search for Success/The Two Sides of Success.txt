The two sides of success:
- The outer life: achievements, career, recognition, celebrity, respect from others, the role you play and the social occupations that you found your way to
- The inner life:  what you really care about



================================================================================

When you unpack the word success for
the first time, it's like a box, and you open a box,
and you look inside. The first thing you notice and
you probably notice this in the six lives exercise, because no matter
which life you were reading, each of them had these two dimensions. So when you open the box and look inside,
what you find is two boxes inside the box. I called one box the outer life,
and the other box the inner life. The outer life has to
do with achievements, career, recognition, celebrity, respect from others,
the roles you play and the social occupations that
you found your way to. And the outer life is what
most people think of, when they just hear the word success. They think, someone's successful,
it means that they are, the president of their bank, or
they graduated from college, or they have some sort of invention
that they made or something. So the outer life is what the media
covers, the outer life is what magazines celebrate, and the outer
life is what people get awards for. And for that reason,
people often think that, that's all it is. But then there's this conundrum because if
you take an average person on the street and you just ask them randomly, which I
sometimes do just because it's my field. And I'm trying to kill time in a grocery
store line while someone is counting pennies at the very beginning of
the line to pay for their fruit salad. I asked somebody, I'm doing a little
survey, what do you think success means? And if they're willing to answer
the question and they don't think I'm too weird then they will be almost always
inclined to say, well, I don't know. It seems to me like success is happiness. If you're happy, you're successful. And if you ask somebody
what's your goal for your children, almost all of them would
say, well, we just want them to be happy. So on one end you've got this
societal point of view of the box of the outer life where all that we
celebrate is achievements and career and position and status and
on the other hand we have this inner life. The other part which is what most people
resort to when they kind of think about they really care about. And so, there's just contradiction
between these two sides of success. And a lot of what we're going to
do together in this course and that you will be trying to resolve in your
own life as you go through your life, is reconciling and integrating and balancing the outer life and
thee inner life. And the credit you give yourself for having a life that is rich
in its inner dimensions or highly recognized in its outer dimensions,
and what happens between those two. I think it's often the case that we make
choices in our lives that favor the outer life, and then we have regrets and second guessing because we've
come up short on the inner life. I think it's hard to choose
the inner life over the outer life. Sometimes because it looks so
unimportant, but of course at the end of your
life I think most people are pretty inclined to think
that they would not say, gee, I wish I could have another day to
be alive so I could work some more. I think they're probably going to be
asking themselves for another day so they could be with the people
they love for another day. So these two sides of success are going to
be with us throughout the course and how you consider them a big theme
in how we're going to analyze, break down, and think about all
the different topics that we talk about. So in our next session, we'll be picking up some themes related
to everything we've talked about so far.
