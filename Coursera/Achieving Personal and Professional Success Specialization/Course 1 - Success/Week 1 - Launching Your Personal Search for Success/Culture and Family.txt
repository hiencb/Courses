The role of culture and family in setting your success values



================================================================================

So we've talked about
the box that success is, and that inside the box you find two other
boxes, the inner life of happiness and fulfillment and the outer life of career,
status, and achievement. But you might ask yourself,
how did this box get filled up? Who put it all there? And the most important next layer you
have to penetrate as you begin thinking about what success really means to
you is the sources of these values. And you immediately confront a very, very important cultural source for
the values. And within any given culture,
your family will be like a prism that will focus certain aspects of the cultural
values that are salient to your families into your sets of assumptions
about what you ought to be doing. And what counts and what doesn't count,
and what will earn you praise or what will earn you disappointment. So culture and family,
two really important things, and very difficult to get a grip on. There was a novelist,
David Foster Wallace, a modern novelist who gave a commencement
address at Kenyon College in 2005. And he told the story that I think
illustrates why this is such a difficult subject to get a grip on. And in the story he said
that there was an old fish that was swimming along in the water, and two teenage fish came swimming around and
passed him going the other way. And as the two teenage fish went by him, the old fish said to them,
how's the water? And the two teenage fish were a little
upset with being spoken to by a stranger, and they didn't really know what to do,
so they just kept swimming. But about ten yards away, the one teenage
fish turned to the other teenage fish and said to, well, what's water? Now that question of course
is the kind of question that teenage fish would have
more trouble answering. Because the older you get,
the more experience you have, the more different life events have
happened to you, the more you become aware that you're swimming in your own culture,
with your own cultural assumptions. And that you are motivated by,
impelled by, kind of almost obsessively seeking
validation within the cultural and family values that you've been
surrounded by your whole life. They are part of you, just the way
that your heart is part of your body. So separating yourself from that,
getting perspective on that, so that you can embrace, modify,
reject the cultural and family values that have
defined success for you. A very important part of the journey
that studying the subject and thinking about success has in store.
