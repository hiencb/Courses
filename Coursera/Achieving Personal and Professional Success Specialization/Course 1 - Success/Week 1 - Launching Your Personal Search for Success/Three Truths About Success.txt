Tree truths about success and what you will come to terms with
- There isn't a secret
- Success is not something you find
- There are no foolproof techniques to achive success



================================================================================

In this session, we're going to talk about
three truths about success that I hope you'll come to terms with
as the course goes along. These are three very important things
that often people get confused about. So the first is really the most
important of the three. Many people, because they've read books or
seen movies about success, have the impression that there is
some single secret to success. That if they're only able to uncover it, that it'll answer all their questions,
all the problems will be resolved and that life will eb a completely
rosy experience from there on. And the truth about success
is much more complicated. It's not a secret,
it's complicated because the answer to these questions lies within you,
not outside here. And I think it's always simpler for we humans if we can just
put ourselves on a quest. And then go look for the tallest
mountain or the most exotic plant and then we can say we found it,
we're successful. Unfortunately success is
something that you carry with you. There's a wonderful book by
an author named Ram Dass, the title of the book is
No Matter Where You Go, There You Are. And when it comes to success, I think that's a more the truth
than it's out there someplace. So no secrets, this is all going to
be stuff that you find on your own, in yourself that I think will give
you a higher sense of confidence in what it is that you're striving toward. Just underline that,
the second truth is that this is not a quest of discovery as much
as it is a quest to recognize. To recognize the patterns
you already have within you, to recognize the values that
you're striving to accomplish. These values may come from your family, they may come from your culture,
they may come from a religion. And recognizing them
means understanding and finding the familiar the value
of say compassion for others. Recognizing that you were taught that,
but that you sort of forgot it in your quest to get to the top of the
ladder or to cure some dreaded disease. And you've now got a chance to think and
go, well you know what? I see that value inside me,
I now can honor it in a different way. And it doesn't mean you have to stop
looking for the cure for the disease. It just means that you bring this value, whatever it might be compassion's
an example, you bring it along with you. It doesn't take any more time to do that. It just brings a deeper understanding
to your relationships when you do it. So it's about recognition, not about finding new things
you've never thought of. And then the third truth that I hope
we'll uncover as the course goes along is that are no single foolproof
techniques that work every time to achieve whatever the success value
is that you've decided to embrace. In the how to succeed market,
if you go to any book store, go online and Google the word success. You're going to find just boat loads
of books on how to succeed and almost all of them are going to provide
this template of one true path. The one true path may be goal setting,
the one true path may be social skills, the one true path may be mind power and
visualization, and the power of your imagination
to bring things into reality. Again, all these things may
be perfectly relevant and they may be very useful to you. But the chances are pretty high
that you're going to use your own unique combination of them with
your own unique experiences and capabilities to build on them. And what works for the person who lives
next door to you, who needs to learn how to set goals, will not work for you
because you already set 200 goals a day. And you're going to be trying to figure
out how to relax and focus on three goals. So no fool proof techniques every time,
but lots of techniques. Your goal is to try to adapt for yourself
the tools that will work uniquely well for you, to achieve whatever
your success goals are. They may be internal goals,
they may be external goals or a combination of the two. I think as the course goes on you're
going to get a richer sense of how those two play against each other, and sort of
fold in and integrate with each other. So we'll be addressing some of
these issues in our next session.
